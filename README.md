## Projects

### 1: Developing a Deep Learning Model for Eyewear Detection
![Glasses Detection](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/blob/main/images/glasses_detection.png)
- **Description**: This project focused on addressing the challenging task of automatic glasses detection in facial analysis. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was designed and trained on a large dataset of facial images labeled with glasses and non-glasses categories.

### 2: Pridicting Heart Disease by using Neural Networks
- **Description**: In this project, the aim was to predict the likelihood of heart disease using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The dataset provided contained various health-related attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and exercise habits, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

### 3: Sentiment Analysis of Omicron Variant Tweets
- **Description**: This project delved into sentiment analysis of tweets pertaining to the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the objective was to discern the sentiment expressed in these tweets, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral to gauge public perception towards the Omicron variant.

### 4: Predicting Footfalls using SARIMA Model
- **Description**: In this project, the goal was to forecast footfall values using a SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The dataset provided consisted of footfall data spanning multiple months, with a total of 158 data points. The primary objective was to leverage the SARIMA model to predict the footfall values for the next 10 time periods.

### 5: Predicting House Prices with Ensemble Techniques
- **Description**: This project focused on predicting house prices using ensemble learning techniques, specifically AdaBoost and XGBoost. The dataset contained various housing features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

### 6: Machine Learning Model That Can Predict The Pulser Star
- **Description**:In this project, I used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict pulsar stars in astronomical data. After preprocessing the dataset, I implemented an SVM classifier with scikit-learn, optimizing the model through different kernels and hyperparameters. The model achieved high accuracy and reliability, effectively distinguishing between pulsar and non-pulsar observations, supporting pulsar research and celestial studies.

### 7: Analysis of COVID-19 Lockdown Measures
- **Description**:This capstone project focuses on the analysis of COVID-19 lockdown measures and their impact on daily cases. With the global pandemic significantly affecting various aspects of society, understanding the effectiveness of lockdown measures is crucial for mitigating the spread of the virus and minimizing socio-economic impacts.
